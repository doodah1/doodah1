- 👋 Hi, I’m @doodah1
- 👀 I’m interested in ... finding out everything that these electronics of today have and how they work especially when it comes to the safety issues and keeping my family safe from cyber bullies and giving them the security that they deserve instead of not knowing and falling victim to the choices of those that empower theirselves with these modern weapons that run the universe and all those that live on it. I believe in God but I don't believe that turning the other cheek is the right thing to do but understanding that the life you have is yours to empower your body is yours to make into everything you want it to be and you can only do that through knowledge cause knowledge is power and those that aquire it rule the world as leaders protectors and fathers to those we love and live forð
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...how to turn my phone on would be great cause I know nothing I even have to look up every third word in the dictionary when reading my brothers and sisters so I can understand what is being told to me when we are in discussions which makes things a bit frustrating since I need as much help as I can get understanding these principles and languages so I too can keep my family safe and give them that sense of security that they very well deserve in life just like all of those that look up to us and trust us to nurture protect and keep them safe and nurtured in the right direction in life that sense of security has to be given so they can trust us and experiance what life is all about so please i know it will be frustrating but those that have patients and those that dont i ask please find it some how and if you have some time help me to be a bad ass for those that depend on me please and thank you
